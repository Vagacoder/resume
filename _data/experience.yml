# Jobs
# Research Scientist on Stem Cell Therapy (CIRM project)
- company: UC Santa Barbara
  position: Project Scientist
  duration: June, 2009 &mdash; October 2016
  summary: Develop a stem cell based treatment for age-related macular degeneration as a part of The California Project to Cure Blindness funded by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine. My research focuses on improving the differentiation efficiency of human embryonic stem (hES) cells into retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells, by studying the roles of miRNAs, growth factors, and small molecules. The RPE differentiation efficiency was improved from 5% to 50% in 45 days. I developed release assays to determine the purity and efficacy of the cellular products. The QC assays are able to detect 0.01% contaminant cells using flow cytometry and RT-QPCR.

# Postdocotral Scholar of California Institute for Regenerative Medicine Training Program
- company: UC Santa Barbara
  position: Postdocotral Scholar
  duration: November, 2007 &mdash; May, 2009
  summary: Study the molecular basis of cellular reprogramming. The first project focused on the mechanisms of reprogramming human somatic cells to a pluripotent state. I was the first to show that RPE cells could be reprogrammed to become iPS cells. I showed that some iPS lines retained an epigenetic memory of their origin, and traced that memory to miRNA regulation

# Doctoral Research
- company: Washington University in St.Louis, School of Medicine
  position: Ph. D. student
  duration:  2004  &mdash; 2007
  summary: My thesis work investigated the mechanisms of inherited cardiovascular and skin disease. I identified mutations in fibulin-5 and elastin genes that give rise to cutis laxa, and showed that some mutations result in protein misfolding. I established the first transgenic mouse model of cutis laxa by introducing elastin mutations into mice. I showed that these mice have pulmonary phenotypes similar to the human disease and thus it is a potential model for developing therapies.
