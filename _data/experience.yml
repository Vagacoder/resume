# Jobs
# Research Scientist on Stem Cell Therapy (CIRM project)
- company: UC Santa Barbara
  position: Project Scientist
  duration: June, 2009 &mdash; October 2016
  summary: Develop a stem cell based treatment for age-related macular degeneration as a part of 
  The California Project to Cure Blindness funded by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine.
  My research focuses on improving the differentiation efficiency of human embryonic stem (hES) cells into 
  retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells, by studying the roles of miRNAs, growth factors, and small molecules. 
  The RPE differentiation efficiency was improved from 5% to 50% in 45 days. 
  I developed release assays to determine the purity and efficacy of the cellular products. 
  The QC assays are able to detect 0.01% contaminant cells using flow cytometry and RT-QPCR.

# Postdocotral Scholar of California Institute for Regenerative Medicine Training Program
- company: UC Santa Barbara
  position: Postdocotral Scholar
  duration: November, 2007 &mdash; May, 2009
  summary: Study the molecular basis of cellular reprogramming. The first project focused on the mechanisms of reprogramming 
  human somatic cells to a pluripotent state. I was the first to show that RPE cells could be reprogrammed to become iPS cells. 
  I showed that some iPS lines retained an epigenetic memory of their origin, and traced that memory to miRNA regulation
